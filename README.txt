In the analysis, the objective of the analysis helps us to understand each variable and its effect on
the dependent variable. Predictive modeling and its output will be performed using linear regression
and trying to understand the performance of the linear regression model using RMSE, Rˆ2, and other
metrics

Introduction

The analysis involves 2 parts. i.e data analysis and machine learning. In data analysis, all 26 features
will be analyzed along with their dependency on the dependent variable.

About Data

This dataset consists of data From 1985 Ward’s Automotive Yearbook. Here are the sources

2) Personal Auto Manuals, Insurance Services Office, 160 Water Street, New York, NY 10038

Content

This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various
characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to
other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is riskier than its price
indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with their price. Then, if it is
riskier (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this
process “symboling”. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is
normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
sports/specialty, etc. . . ), and represents the average loss per car per year.
Objective of the Study
In the Analysis, we can find how each variable is affecting the output i.e price and using these variables
how can create a predictive model.

Overview of the Data

The Data consists of 205 rows and 26 variables out of which there are 25 independent variables and the
rest are dependent variables.
